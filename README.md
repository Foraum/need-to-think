# FPGA-Driven Sine Wave Regeneration using ADC-DAC
## Project Description
This project focuses on the implementation of the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol by interfacing an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) with an FPGA. The primary aim of the project is to regenerate a sine wave using these components, demonstrating the real-time conversion of analog signals to digital and back to analog.

The project is divided into three distinct tasks:

* VHDL Code Development for SPI Master and SPI Slave
* -  ADC to LCD via SPI
  -  SPI to DAC and multimeter
* Regeneration of Sine Wave using ADC - DAC
